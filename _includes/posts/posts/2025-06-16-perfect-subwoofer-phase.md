**Perfect Subwoofer Phase in 30 Seconds**

You’ve dialed in level and crossover, but the low end still sounds hollow or bloated. The culprit? Your subwoofer’s phase may be fighting your mains.

**Tip**  
Play a track you know with tight, clear bass. Sit at your listening position while someone flips your subwoofer’s phase control—typically marked 0° and 180°. Choose the setting that gives you the tightest, punchiest bass. Still unsure? Listen for where the bass suddenly “locks in” and sounds both stronger and more integrated.

If your sub has a variable phase knob, slowly rotate from 0° to 180° while listening and stop at the strongest, clearest result.

**Here’s Why That Works**  
Your main speakers and subwoofer produce overlapping frequencies. If their waveforms arrive out of phase, they interfere and cancel—resulting in weak, indistinct bass. Matching phase ensures coherent arrival, summing energy rather than nulling it. It’s the single fastest way to dramatically improve low-frequency performance:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
